![Cryzers-Drugs Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Cryzers-Drugs+Mod)  
*Grow your own cannabis and craft joints to manage stress in the zombie apocalypse!*

**Cryzers-Drugs** is a mod for *Project Zomboid* that lets you grow cannabis plants, craft joints, and use them as alternative medicine to reduce stress, unhappiness, and pain. Survive the apocalypse by cultivating your own crops, but beware of the negative effects like hunger, thirst, and fatigue. This mod adds immersive farming and crafting mechanics for a unique survival experience.

## Features

- **Cannabis Farming**: Plant cannabis seeds, nurture them, and harvest plants to create joints.
- **Drying Mechanic**: Dry harvested cannabis plants for 6–7 days in a safe, dry location to produce usable dope.
- **Crafting System**: Grind dope and craft joints using a grinder and other materials.
- **Balanced Effects**: Joints reduce stress (-25), unhappiness (-10), and pain (-17), but increase hunger (+15), thirst (+15), and fatigue (+20).
- **Smoker Trait Bonus**: Characters with the Smoker trait gain enhanced benefits from joints.
- **New Items**: Includes Grinder, Cannabis Seed, Cannabis Seed Bag, and Joint, spawning in logical locations.
- **Lore-Friendly**: Fits seamlessly into Project Zomboid’s gritty, post-apocalyptic world.

## Usage

### What Can You Find in the World?
- **Grinder**: Used to grind dried cannabis into dope.
- **Cannabis Seed**: Plant to grow cannabis.
- **Cannabis Seed Bag**: Contains multiple seeds for planting.
- **Joint**: Crafted item that can be smoked for effects.

Items spawn in logical locations like houses, pharmacies, or hidden stashes. Check containers like cabinets, bags, or crates.

### How It Works
1. **Plant a Cannabis Seed**: Use a Cannabis Seed or Seed Bag to start growing a plant. Ensure proper farming conditions (e.g., soil, water).
2. **Care for the Plant**: Water and monitor the plant’s health to ensure a good harvest.
3. **Harvest**: Collect mature cannabis plants.
4. **Dry the Plants**: Place harvested plants in a dry location (e.g., inside your base) for 6–7 days. If plants get wet, the drying process resets.
5. **Process the Dope**: Use dried plants to obtain dope.
6. **Grind the Dope**: Use a Grinder to prepare the dope for crafting.
7. **Craft a Joint**: Combine ground dope with other materials to create a Joint.
8. **Smoke and Enjoy**: Right-click the Joint to smoke it. Smokers gain enhanced benefits.

### Drying Cannabis
- Place harvested cannabis plants in a dry, sheltered location (e.g., inside a building).
- Drying takes 6–7 days. If the plants get wet (e.g., from rain), the drying process restarts.
- Store plants carefully to avoid losing progress.

### Benefits of Smoking a Joint
- **Stress Reduction**: -25 Stress
- **Happiness Boost**: -10 Unhappiness
- **Pain Relief**: -17 Pain
- *Smoker Bonus*: Characters with the Smoker trait experience stronger or longer-lasting effects.

### Disadvantages of Smoking a Joint
- **Increased Hunger**: +15 Hunger
- **Increased Thirst**: +15 Thirst
- **Increased Fatigue**: +20 Fatigue

*Tip*: Monitor your character’s moodles to manage negative effects. Stock up on food and water before smoking.
